# Plots with ggplot2

We are going to make plots in R and it's going to be amazing.
```{r libraries}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(here)
```
```{r read in files}
ca_np <- read_csv(here("data", "ca_np.csv"))

names(ca_np) #see variable names
head(ca_np) #see first X rows (6 is default)
summary(ca_np) #see a summary of each variable

ci_np <- read_excel(here("data", "ci_np.xlsx"))
```

```{r plots}
ggplot(data = ci_np, aes(x = year, y = visitors)) +
  geom_line()

gg_base <- ggplot(data = ci_np, aes(x = year, y = visitors)) #storing as an object to avoid retyping

gg_base +
  geom_col() #make it a column graph

gg_base +
  geom_line(
    color = "purple",
    linetype = "dashed"
  )

gg_base + 
  geom_point(color = "purple",
             pch = 17,
             size = 4,
             alpha = 0.5)

gg_base + 
  geom_point(
    aes(size = visitors, #size and color of points change
        color = visitors), #based on number of visitors
    alpha = 0.5 #opacity stays the same regardless (still within geom_point layer)
  )
#to update aesthetics based on a variable, put that argument inside aes

gg_base + 
  geom_col(aes(fill = visitors))
```
